* stack and heap
stack memory is used for local object, local var, argument passed, return val.
heap memory is dynamically allocated using new, this memory is managed by OS.

** life span
*** heap object
#+begin_src c++
{
  complex *p = new complex(2,1);
}
#+end_src
when the program goes out of the scope, the object pointed by p is still alive but we can't access because the p is local var. In this case, it will cause memory leak , so we need to release when not use it anymore.
*** global object
the whole program
*** static local object
the whole program

* new
new expression memory firstly and then evoke the ctor, it will be divided three ops like that.
- allocate memory ( using c-malloc )
- convert type
- ctor
#+begin_src c++
complex *pc = new complex(2,1);
--->

void *mem = operator new (sizeof(complex)); // operator new function is c++ function which will use malloc.
pc = static_cast<complex*>(mem);
pc->complex::complex(2,1); // Complex::Complex(pc, 2, 1);// this
#+end_src

* delete
call dtor first and then release memory.
- dtor
- free memory using free function

#+begin_src c++
complex *pc = new complex(2,1);
...
delete pc;

complex::~complex(pc);// dtor
operator delete(pc); // operator delete is c++ inside function which will call free to release memory.

complex *ps = new String("hello");
...
delete ps;
     2.
ps-->|-----|           1.
     |     |---------->|-------------|
     |-----|           |hello        |
                       |-------------|
         
#+end_src

step1. will call String::~String() dtor, delete m_data, release allocate memory storing hello string (actually release the pointer storage).
step2. will call delete operator which free(ps) the memory storing pointer to String.

* detail of allocated memory in c++
#+begin_src 
one element         array
|-------|     |-------|
|malloc |     |malloc |
|cookie |     |cookie |
|-------|     |-------|
|       |     | size  |
|       |     |-------|
|Complex|     |Complex|
|       |     |-------|
|       |     |Complex|
|-------|     |-------|
| pad   |     | pad   |
|-------|     |-------|
|malloc |     |malloc |
|cookie |     |cookie |
|-------|     |-------|
#+end_src

When you don't use new [] ( new array) and delete [] (delete array) in pair, it will cause memory leak which doesn in your diet.

#+begin_src 
String *p = new String [3]; |   String *p = new String [3];
delete[] p;                 |   delete p;

wake up 3 dtor,another one just wake up one time.

And the string "world" and string "zhh" is still in memory without release in one time dtor.
